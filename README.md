# Polynomials
Implementing arithmetic operations on polynomials with coefficients in Z3 (modular arithmetic).
Key features:
- The project follows the rules of object oriented-programming. In particular, the class uses destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator. Setters and getters enable encapsulation.
- Basic arithemtic operators both on Z3 numbers and polynomials with coefficients in Z3 are overloaded, together with multiplication by scalar and polynomial division.
- Unpermitted operations such as division by zero throw exceptions.
